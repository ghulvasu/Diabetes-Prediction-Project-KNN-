# Diabetes-Prediction-Project-KNN-
A machine learning project using KNN to predict diabetes.

### Diabetes Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on health parameters like glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age. It’s built using Python and various data science libraries.

### 🚀 Project Highlights
- Loaded and explored the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
- Handled outliers using the IQR method.
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.
- Trained a **KNN classification model**.
- Evaluated with **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.
- Visualized actual vs. predicted values.
